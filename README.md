# Grafonnet

Jsonnet libraries for writing Grafana dashboards as code.

> :information_source: We are in the process of putting together a new generated version
> of Grafonnet. This new version will keep up-to-date with new features in Grafana as
> they are introduced.
> This new version of Grafana will have a new GitHub repository - more details soon.
>
> Once the new Grafonnet repository has been made public, this repo will be marked as
> deprecated and archived. You will still be able to use this code in your dashboards,
> but no further development will occur. We encourage you to check out the new Grafonnet
> when it comes. Not long now - hold on tight!
